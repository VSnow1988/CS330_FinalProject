# CS330_FinalProject
Simple OpenGL 3D scene with lighting and textures.
NOTE: File directory will need to be reconstructed according to the code to run. An unsolved error is causing the zipped folders to turn out a whopping 42 MB, which will not upload to github, despite the original files being under 10MB total.

## Setting Up

This project was made following the class tutorial, with setup instructions here: https://github.com/SNHU-CS/CS-330
It depends upon several OpenGL libraries and was made in Visual Studio 2022.

### Class Refelection

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project practiced using OpenGL as well as understanding 3D art and computer-generated graphics concepts.
  
What design process did you follow for your project work?

The project was divided into steps: Planning & Design (choosing the image and deciding which shapes to use for the objects), development, and testing.
  
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Understanding the limitations of technology and what was expected from the final result helped in the decision of what image to use. I can understand how to create a complex object out of simple shapes. Every project needs a planning phase as well as a testing phase after development.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

There weren't really any new strategies applied to this. It was just a standard plan, develop, and iterative test process.

How did iteration factor into your development?

This was a complex project, so of course developing and testing one part at a time was important. It would have been quite a struggle trying to code this all at    once and expect it to run. Without doing this in smaller design-develop-test iterations, it would no doubt be full of errors that would have been difficult to      find the root of.
  
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

  During certain parts, it was easy to just visualize and jump right into development to save time. There were also times when I had to go back into a re-design      phase to try a different angle because what I was doing was not working out. Each part of the project over the six weeks was approached differently according to 
  the task's complexity and how many problems were encountered.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

  This might potentially be applied in developing applications in later classes, but I'm not sure. I do plan on learning to work with 3D graphics later as an artist, so some of the concepts covered in this class might be helpful.
  
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

  As an artist it's very useful to be able to understand the connection between the design and the computer science aspect of creating something. When you know exactly how a program works on a lower level, it is easier to solve problems and intuitively understand how an interface works. The terms and concepts learned here were general 3D design terms. I might like to get into 3D graphics for advertising, media, and video games.
